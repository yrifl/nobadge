Warning: Read the readme!

> What's this?

This simple Python program removes all of your Roblox Badges! Becareful.

> Why did I make this?

Badges are cringe for me.

> Requirements?

The requirements are Python itself, and package `requests`.

To install `requests` type in `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests` in your cmd or terminal. And run it with double-clicking the file <src/nobadge.py> or run from the command-line `python src/nobadge.py` or `python3 src/nobadge.py`

> Others?

It's completely opensource but don't steal skids!
